**Verification Results:**
- ✅ All acceptance criteria verified in code and documentation
- ✅ `swift build` passes
- ✅ Working tree is clean
- ✅ Progress log updated (commit a12b646)

**What was implemented (in previous iteration):**
- Audio engine reset before each recording session
- Engine prepared before setting input device  
- Input device set after engine preparation (audioUnit available)
- Format queried after device is set
