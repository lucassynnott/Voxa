There are still 6 more stories remaining (US-803 through US-808), so the PRD is not fully complete. US-802 is complete and all changes have been committed.

Let me write a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I successfully verified and documented the completion of **US-802: Start Recording Button**. The implementation was already in place from a previous parallel run, and I:

1. **Verified the implementation** - All code was already committed:
   - `startRecordingButton` view in `HomeContentView` with pill-shaped design using `Capsule()` and terracotta background
   - Microphone icon with pulse animation (Circle scale/opacity animation when recording)
   - Keyboard shortcut badge showing "⌘⇧Space"  
   - Hover lift effect (shadow, scale, Y offset changes)
   - Recording functionality connected via NotificationCenter notifications

2. **Added notification support** - The `.toggleRecording` and `.recordingStateChanged` notifications enable communication between the UI and AppDelegate

3. **Verified build** - `swift build` passes successfully

4. **Updated documentation** - The IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and progress.md were already updated with implementation notes

All **acceptance criteria** are met:
- ✅ Button triggers recording
- ✅ Hover state with lift effect  
- ✅ Shows "Stop Recording" when active (changes text, icon, and color to red)
