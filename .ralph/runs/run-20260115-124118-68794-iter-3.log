## Summary

**US-708: Remove Separate Settings Window** has been completed and verified.

### What was done:
1. **SettingsWindow.swift deleted entirely** - The entire file was removed since all settings are now integrated into the main window
2. **SettingsOpenFullButton removed** from MainWindow.swift - No longer needed
3. **AppDelegate.openSettings()** updated to call `openMainWindow(initialNavItem: .settings)` instead of opening a separate settings window
4. **MainWindowView** already listens for `.openSettings` notification and navigates to Settings tab
5. **MainWindowController.showMainWindow(initialNavItem:)** posts notification when window already exists to trigger navigation

### Acceptance Criteria Verified:
- ✅ No separate settings window opens (SettingsWindowController class and file removed)
- ✅ Menu bar Settings opens main window with Settings selected (via notification + initialNavItem)
- ✅ No orphaned code remains (all references updated, build passes)
