**Summary:**

US-522 (Onboarding Completion) is **complete**. The implementation was already done in a previous run (commit `d1edf69`). This run verified all acceptance criteria:

- ✅ Success screen with checkmarks for completed steps
- ✅ Brief recap of how to use: "Press ⌘⇧Space to start recording"
- ✅ "Start Using WispFlow" button closes wizard
- ✅ `hasCompletedOnboarding` flag set to true
- ✅ Menu bar icon visible and ready
- ✅ Typecheck passes

**Remaining stories in PRD:**
- US-523: Fix Tab Visibility (Phase 6: Settings UI Fixes)
- US-524: Fix Button Interactivity (Phase 6: Settings UI Fixes)
- US-525: Fix ScrollView Interactions (Phase 6: Settings UI Fixes)

Since there are still 3 stories remaining (US-523, US-524, US-525), I will **not** output the completion signal.
