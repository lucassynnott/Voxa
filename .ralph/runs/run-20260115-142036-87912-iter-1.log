## Summary

**US-801: Home Dashboard Header with Time-Based Greeting** is complete.

### What was implemented:
1. **Time-based greeting logic** - `greetingMessage` computed property returns:
   - "Good morning." (before 12pm)
   - "Good afternoon." (12pm-5pm)
   - "Good evening." (after 5pm)

2. **Playfair Display font equivalent** - Added `Font.Voxa.displayGreeting` (52pt serif) to the design system

3. **Subtitle with last session info** - `lastSessionSubtitle` shows relative time since last transcription (e.g., "Ready to capture your thoughts? Your last session was 2 hours ago.")

4. **DASHBOARD label** - Uppercase with `.tracking(4)` for wide letter-spacing

5. **Date and System Active status** - Top-right shows current date ("Thursday, January 15") and "System Active" badge with green dot indicator

### Verification:
- `swift build` → PASS
- Post-commit status: clean
- Commit: `4326ecb feat(dashboard): add time-based greeting header with period (US-801)`

### Remaining Stories:
7 stories remain in Phase 11 (US-802 through US-808).
