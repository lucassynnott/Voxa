## Summary

I have successfully completed **US-205: Silence Detection Fix** with the following changes:

### Key Implementations:
1. **Improved silence detection logic**: Now requires BOTH peak level < -55dB AND >95% near-zero samples (prevents false positives for speech with pauses)
2. **Added `nearZeroPercentage` field** to `AudioBufferStats` for more nuanced silence analysis
3. **Show actual measured dB level** in silence warning dialog (e.g., "Measured level: -72.3dB, Threshold: -55dB")
4. **Debug mode silence bypass**: Added `isSilenceDetectionDisabled` toggle in `DebugManager` with a UI toggle in Settings when debug mode is enabled
5. **Updated all -40dB references** to -55dB in WhisperManager, SettingsWindow, and DebugLogWindow for consistency

### Commits:
- `05083da` feat(US-205): improve silence detection with near-zero sample analysis
- `ba43407` docs: update progress log for US-205

All 5 stories in the PRD (US-201 through US-205) are now complete, marking the completion of WispFlow v0.3.

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
