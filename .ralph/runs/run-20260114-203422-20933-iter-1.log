There are many more stories remaining in the PRD (US-607 through US-631 are not yet complete). This was US-606 which is now complete.

## Summary

US-606: Language Selection has been **verified as complete**. The implementation was already committed in previous iterations (commit `c54111c`):

**What was implemented:**
- **Language dropdown in Settings**: LanguagePicker component with Auto-detect + 11 common languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Arabic)
- **Pass language hint to WhisperKit**: DecodingOptions created in `transcribe()` method with language code and detectLanguage flag
- **Remember language preference**: UserDefaults persistence with key `selectedTranscriptionLanguage`
- **Auto-detect as default**: `TranscriptionLanguage.automatic` is the default, returns `nil` to WhisperKit for automatic language detection

**Files modified:**
- `Sources/WispFlow/WhisperManager.swift` - TranscriptionLanguage enum, selectedLanguage property, DecodingOptions integration
- `Sources/WispFlow/SettingsWindow.swift` - LanguagePicker bound to whisperManager.selectedLanguage

**Build verification:** `swift build` -> PASS
