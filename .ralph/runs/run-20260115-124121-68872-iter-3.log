US-708 is now complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

Successfully completed **US-708: Remove Separate Settings Window**. The changes include:

1. **Removed `SettingsWindowController`** class from SettingsWindow.swift (and the entire file since it was no longer needed)
2. **Updated `AppDelegate.openSettings()`** to call `openMainWindow(initialNavItem: .settings)` instead of the old settings window controller
3. **Added `.openSettings` notification listener** to `MainWindowView` that navigates to the Settings tab when the notification is received
4. **Updated `MainWindowController`** to post the notification when the window already exists and a specific tab is requested
5. **Updated `StatusBarController`** print statement for clarity

The menu bar "Settings..." menu item now opens the main window with the Settings tab selected, providing a unified settings experience. All settings functionality remains accessible through the integrated Settings tab.

**Commits:**
- `921fea8` feat(settings): remove separate settings window (US-708)
- `985b1f2` docs: add progress log entry for US-708 completion
- `98e61a7` docs: mark US-708 tasks complete in implementation plan

**Verification:** Build passes (`swift build` succeeds with no errors).
