## Summary

US-801: Home Dashboard Header with Time-Based Greeting has been completed (verified). The story was already implemented by a parallel agent (commit `4326ecb`).

**What was implemented:**
- **Time-based greeting logic**: Morning (<12pm) → "Good morning.", Afternoon (12pm-5pm) → "Good afternoon.", Evening (>5pm) → "Good evening."
- **Playfair Display style font**: Using 52pt serif design via `Font.Voxa.displayGreeting`
- **Subtitle with last session info**: Shows relative time like "Ready to capture your thoughts? Your last session was 2 hours ago."
- **DASHBOARD label**: Uppercase with `tracking(4)` for wide letter spacing
- **Date and System Active status**: Top-right corner with green dot indicator

**Verification:**
- `swift build` → PASS
- `git status --porcelain` → clean (working tree clean after commit)

**Commit:** `44b5cf5 docs: add verification progress entry for US-801 completion`
