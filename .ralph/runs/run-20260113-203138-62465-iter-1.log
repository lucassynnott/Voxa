I've completed the planning task. Here's a summary:

## Summary

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for **WispFlow v0.5 - Beautiful Modern Light Mode UI** at `/Users/lucasnolan/WispFlow/.ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

### Key Findings:
- **No design system exists** - all styling is currently inline with system defaults
- The codebase mixes AppKit (recording indicator, menu bar) and SwiftUI (settings window)
- Settings window is 520x580px using default Form/Section styling
- Recording indicator uses standard NSVisualEffectView with system colors

### Plan Structure (10 Stories, ~35 Tasks):
1. **US-401**: Design System Foundation (colors, typography, spacing, button/card/toggle styles) - **Must be first**
2. **US-402**: Refined Menu Bar Experience
3. **US-403**: Beautiful Recording Indicator
4. **US-404**: Modern Settings Window (largest visual impact)
5. **US-405-408**: Individual settings tab polish (General, Audio, Transcription, Text Cleanup)
6. **US-409**: Toast Notification System (new component)
7. **US-410**: Micro-interactions & Polish (final pass)

### Notes:
- PRD story markers and routing policy were already correct
- Build verification passed (`swift build`)
- No code modifications made (planning only)
