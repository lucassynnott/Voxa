US-407 is complete! There are still 3 remaining unchecked stories (US-408, US-409, US-410), so the PRD is not yet fully complete.

## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-407: Transcription Settings Tab Polish** with the following changes:

1. **Redesigned model selector as elegant card-based picker** - Replaced radio group with `ModelSelectionCard` components showing model icon, name, size/speed/accuracy specs, and status badges (Active, Downloaded)
