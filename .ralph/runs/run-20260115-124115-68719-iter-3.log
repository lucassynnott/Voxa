All done! Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

**US-708: Remove Separate Settings Window** has been verified as complete.

### What was implemented (by prior iterations):
1. **Removed `SettingsWindowController`** from `SettingsWindow.swift` - the separate settings window controller is no longer used
2. **Updated `AppDelegate.openSettings()`** to call `openMainWindow(initialNavItem: .settings)` instead of using the separate settings window
3. **Updated `MainWindowView`** to listen for `.openSettings` notification and switch to the Settings tab
4. **Updated `MainWindowController.showMainWindow(initialNavItem:)`** to post the `.openSettings` notification when the window already exists
5. **Updated `StatusBarController`** print statements to reflect the new behavior

### Verification:
- ✅ Build passes (`swift build` completes successfully)
- ✅ Working tree is clean (all changes committed)
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met:
  - No separate settings window opens
  - Menu bar Settings opens main window with Settings selected
  - No orphaned code remains
