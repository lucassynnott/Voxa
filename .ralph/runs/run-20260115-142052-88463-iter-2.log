There are still 6 stories remaining (US-803 through US-808), so the PRD is not complete. The task was to implement only US-802, which is now complete.

**Summary:**

US-802: Start Recording Button has been successfully verified as complete. The implementation includes:

1. **Pill-shaped button with terracotta background** - Uses `Capsule()` shape with `Color.Voxa.accent`
2. **Microphone icon with pulse animation** - ZStack with pulsing circle animation when recording active
3. **Keyboard shortcut badge** - Shows "⌘⇧Space" in semi-transparent capsule overlay
4. **Hover lift effect** - Shadow, scale, and Y-offset changes on hover
5. **Recording functionality** - Connected via NotificationCenter (.toggleRecording to trigger, .recordingStateChanged to update state)
6. **Shows "Stop Recording" when active** - Dynamic text, icon, and color changes

All acceptance criteria verified:
- ✅ Button triggers recording
- ✅ Hover state with lift effect
- ✅ Shows Stop Recording when active
