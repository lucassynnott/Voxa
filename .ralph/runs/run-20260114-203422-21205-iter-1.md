## Implementation Summary

The US-606 feature was implemented with the following components:

### WhisperManager.swift
- **TranscriptionLanguage enum**: 12 language options (automatic + 11 common languages)
  - Properties: `displayName`, `flag` (emoji), `whisperLanguageCode`
  - `whisperLanguageCode` returns `nil` for automatic mode (tells WhisperKit to auto-detect)
- **selectedLanguage property**: `@Published var` bound to UI, persisted via UserDefaults
- **DecodingOptions**: Created in `transcribe()` method with language hint and detectLanguage flag

### SettingsWindow.swift
- **LanguagePicker**: Bound to `$whisperManager.selectedLanguage` for two-way binding
- **LanguageRow**: Uses `WhisperManager.TranscriptionLanguage` for type-safe selection

### UserDefaults Persistence
- Key: `selectedTranscriptionLanguage`
- Default: `.automatic` (auto-detect)
