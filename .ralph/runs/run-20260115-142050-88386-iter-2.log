## Summary

**US-802: Start Recording Button** has been verified as complete. All acceptance criteria have been met:

1. ✅ **Button triggers recording** - Posts `.toggleRecording` notification handled by AppDelegate
2. ✅ **Hover state with lift effect** - Shadow radius increases 6→12, Y offset 2→4, scale 1.02, Y offset -2
3. ✅ **Shows Stop Recording when active** - Text, icon (stop.fill), and background color (error red) all change

**Implementation Details:**
- Pill-shaped button using `Capsule()` with `Color.Voxa.accent` (terracotta) background
- Microphone icon with pulse animation (circle scales 1.0→1.4 and fades when recording)
- Keyboard shortcut badge showing "⌘⇧Space"
- Hover lift effect with shadow, scale, and Y offset changes
- Recording state synchronized via NotificationCenter (`.toggleRecording`, `.recordingStateChanged`)

**Verification:**
- `swift build` → PASS (builds successfully in 0.12s)
- Working tree clean
- Commit: `ce6920a docs: add verification progress entry for US-802 (run-20260115-142050-88386)`

There are still 6 remaining stories (US-803 through US-808) in the implementation plan, so the PRD is not yet complete.
