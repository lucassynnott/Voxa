## Summary

**US-801: Home Dashboard Header with Time-Based Greeting** was already fully implemented and committed by parallel agents (commit `4326ecb`). I verified the implementation:

✅ **All Tasks Complete:**
- Time-based greeting logic (morning <12pm, afternoon 12-5pm, evening >5pm)
- Playfair Display-style serif font for greeting (~52pt via `Font.Voxa.displayGreeting`)
- Subtitle with last session info (relative time formatting)
- DASHBOARD label (uppercase, tracking-widest)
- Date and System Active status in top-right

✅ **All Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- Greeting changes based on time of day
- Subtitle shows last session time
- Header layout matches design

✅ **Verification:**
- `swift build` passes
- Working tree is clean
- Progress entry added (commit `da5ad57`)

**Note:** There are 7 remaining stories in Phase 11 (US-802 through US-808) so the PRD is not yet complete.
