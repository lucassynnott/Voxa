**Summary of US-704 Implementation:**

Successfully migrated the Transcription Settings Section to the integrated settings view in `MainWindow.swift`. The implementation includes:

1. **Whisper Model Size Picker**: Card-based selection for Tiny, Base, Small, and Medium models with visual specs (size, speed, accuracy) and status badges (Active/Downloaded)

2. **Model Download Progress**: Gradient progress bar with shimmer effect showing download percentage during model downloads

3. **Language Selection Dropdown**: 12 language options (including Auto-Detect) with flag emojis, checkmarks, and "Recommended" badge, bound to WhisperManager for persistence

4. **Quality/Speed Tradeoff Info**: Dynamic section showing recommendations for each model tier with highlighting based on currently selected model

**Verification:** `swift build` passes ✓
