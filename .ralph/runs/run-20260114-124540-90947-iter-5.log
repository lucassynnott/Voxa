There are still 9 unchecked stories remaining in the PRD (US-517 through US-525), so I should NOT output the `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` signal. US-516 is complete, and I've:

1. ✅ Read guardrails.md before code changes
2. ✅ Read errors.log for repeated failures
3. ✅ Read the PRD
4. ✅ Read and updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for US-516
5. ✅ Fully audited necessary files
6. ✅ Followed AGENTS.md build/test instructions
7. ✅ Implemented only US-516 tasks
8. ✅ Ran verification command (`swift build` → PASS)
9. ✅ Updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with tasks checked and notes
10. ✅ Updated PRD with all acceptance criteria checked and story marked complete
11. ✅ Committed changes with clean working tree
12. ✅ Appended progress entry to progress.md

## Summary

I implemented **US-516: First Launch Detection** for WispFlow's onboarding wizard:

- Created `OnboardingManager.swift` with singleton pattern matching other managers in the codebase
- The manager checks `UserDefaults` for `hasCompletedOnboarding` flag on initialization
- First launch detection: `isFirstLaunch` returns true when flag is nil or false
- Flag is only set to true via `markOnboardingCompleted()` or `markOnboardingSkipped()` methods (not before wizard is done)
- Typecheck passes (`swift build` successful)
- Commits: `deecf6f` (implementation) and `0e5ec8a` (progress log update)
