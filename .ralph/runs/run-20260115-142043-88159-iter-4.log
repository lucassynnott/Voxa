## Summary

**US-805: Quick Tools Section** has been completed with the following changes:

1. **Created `QuickToolAction` enum** in MainWindow.swift with two cases:
   - `aiTextCleanup` - for AI Text Cleanup feature
   - `importAudio` - for Import Audio feature

2. **Created `QuickToolButton` component** with:
   - Bordered button style with 1px border
   - Icon on left, title/description text, and chevron on right
   - Hover states where border and icon turn terracotta color (`Color.Voxa.accent`)
   - Smooth animations via `VoxaAnimation.quick`

   - Section header uses `Font.Voxa.sectionHeaderItalic` (serif italic 18pt)
   - Two tool buttons displayed horizontally

   - AI Text Cleanup → Posts `.navigateToTextCleanup` → Navigates to Settings tab
   - Import Audio → Posts `.openAudioImport` → Shows file picker for audio files

5. **Added notification names** to ToastView.swift:
   - `.audioFileSelected` for audio file selection callback
