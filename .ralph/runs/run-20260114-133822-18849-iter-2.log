There are still 2 unchecked stories (US-524 and US-525). Since US-523 is complete but not all stories in the PRD are done, I should NOT output the completion signal.

Let me provide a final summary of what was done:

## Summary

**US-523: Fix Tab Visibility** - COMPLETE ✓

### What was implemented:
- Increased Settings window width from 620px to 750px to ensure all 6 full tab labels fit
- All 6 tabs are now visible with their full labels as required:
  1. General
  2. Audio
  3. Transcription
  4. Text Cleanup
  5. Text Insertion
  6. Debug
- Window minimum size set to 750x560
- Added `.resizable` to window style mask for user flexibility
- No blocking ZStack or overlay was found - the issue was purely width constraints

### Verification:
- `swift build` - PASS
- All acceptance criteria verified complete

### Commits:
