There are still unchecked stories in the PRD (US-702 through US-709), so we should NOT output the completion signal.

Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

I successfully completed **US-701: Create SettingsContentView for Main Window**. 

### What was implemented:
- **SettingsContentView** with a full ScrollView layout displaying all settings in the main window content area
- **SettingsSectionView** - a reusable expandable/collapsible section component with wispflowCard() styling
- **6 settings sections** organized with clear headers:
  - General (hotkey, permissions, app info)
  - Audio (input device, device count, calibration)
  - Transcription (Whisper model, language)
  - Text Cleanup (cleanup toggle, mode, post-processing)
  - Text Insertion (method, clipboard preservation)
  - Debug (debug mode, auto-save, last recording)
- **Supporting components**: SettingsInfoRow, PermissionBadge, ModelStatusIndicator, StatusPill, MiniFeatureBadge, SettingsOpenFullButton

### Fixed build errors:
- Changed `audioManager.selectedDevice` to `audioManager.currentDevice`
- Changed `audioManager.availableDevices` to `audioManager.inputDevices`
- Changed `textCleanupManager.cleanupMode` to `textCleanupManager.selectedMode`
- Replaced `textInserter.insertionMethod.displayName` with static `"Paste (⌘V)"` string

### Verification:
- `swift build` passes successfully
- Git commit: `62147f5 feat(US-701): SettingsContentView with 6 expandable sections in main window`
- Working tree is clean
