## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-306: Audio Debug Export**. The implementation enhances the audio debugging workflow with:

1. **Export Functionality**: Added "Quick Export" button that saves recordings directly to `~/Documents/WispFlow/DebugRecordings/` with timestamped filenames

2. **Auto-Save Mode**: New toggle in Debug Settings that automatically saves every recording when debug mode is enabled

3. **Playback Support**: Integrated AVAudioPlayer with Play/Stop button to verify exported audio directly from the app

4. **Finder Integration**: "Show in Finder" and "Open Recordings Folder" buttons for quick file access

5. **Detailed Logging**: All export operations are logged with `[US-306]` prefix showing sample count, duration, sample rate, file size, and path

All 6 stories in PRD v0.4 (US-301 through US-306) are now complete:
- Commit: `3cab35e feat(US-306): add audio debug export with auto-save, playback, and detailed logging`
- Commit: `8e2d304 docs: update progress log for US-306`
