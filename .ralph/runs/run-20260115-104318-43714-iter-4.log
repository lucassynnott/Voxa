## Summary

US-634: Transcription History View has been verified as complete. The implementation was already done in a previous iteration (commit `d6eea7a`) and includes:

**Data Model Changes (`UsageStatsManager.swift`):**
- Extended `TranscriptionEntry` with `fullText` field for complete transcription text
- Added migration decoder for backward compatibility with existing entries
- Enhanced `removeEntry()` to update totals when entries are deleted
- Added `searchEntries(query:)` for real-time search filtering
- Added `groupEntriesByDate(_:)` for date category grouping
- Created `DateCategory` enum: Today, Yesterday, This Week, This Month, Older

**UI Implementation (`MainWindow.swift`):**
- Full `HistoryContentView` with header, search bar, and grouped list
- `HistoryEntryCard` component with expand/collapse, copy, delete functionality
- Real-time search with highlighted matches using AttributedString
- Empty state and no-results state views
- Smooth animations for filtering and transitions

**Verification:**
- Build passes: `swift build` ✅
- Post-commit status: clean ✅
- Commit: `2a76daf docs: add progress log for US-634 verification run`

**Remaining stories:** US-635 (Snippets Library View) and US-636 (Custom Dictionary View) are still open.
