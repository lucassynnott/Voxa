**Commit:** `8e7013f docs: add verification progress log for US-523 iteration 4`

**Note:** Not all stories in the PRD are complete - there are 6 open Phase 2 stories (US-615, US-632-636) for a new UI overhaul. Since US-523 was the selected story and it's complete, but not all stories in the PRD are complete, I do not output the COMPLETE signal.
