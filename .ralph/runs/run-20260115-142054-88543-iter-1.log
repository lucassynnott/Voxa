The run logs have been committed. The US-801 story has been verified as complete.

## Summary

I verified that **US-801: Home Dashboard Header with Time-Based Greeting** was already fully implemented by a parallel agent (commit 4326ecb). The implementation includes:

1. **Time-based greeting logic** - `greetingMessage` computed property that returns "Good morning.", "Good afternoon.", or "Good evening." based on the hour
2. **Playfair Display style font** - Using `Font.Voxa.displayGreeting` (52pt serif) for an elegant editorial appearance
3. **Last session subtitle** - Shows "Ready to capture your thoughts? Your last session was X ago." with relative time formatting
4. **DASHBOARD label** - Uppercase text with tracking(4) for wide letter spacing
5. **Date and System Active status** - Top-right header with current date and green status indicator

All acceptance criteria are met:
- ✅ Greeting changes based on time of day
- ✅ Subtitle shows last session time
- ✅ Header layout matches design

The story is marked as complete in the implementation plan, and I've added a progress entry documenting this verification run.
