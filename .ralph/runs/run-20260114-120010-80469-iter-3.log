There are many remaining stories in the PRD. US-505 is now complete, and I should not output the completion signal.

Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-505: Low-Quality Device Warning** for WispFlow.

### Changes made:
1. **SettingsWindow.swift**:
   - Updated `AudioDevicePicker` to detect and display warning icons for low-quality devices (airpods, bluetooth, beats, headset, hfp, wireless)
   - Added tooltip explanations for each device type using SwiftUI's `.help()` modifier
   - Updated `AudioDeviceRow` to show warning icon and "May reduce transcription accuracy" subtitle for flagged devices
   - Passed `audioManager` reference to `AudioDevicePicker` for consistent quality detection

2. **AppDelegate.swift**:
   - Added toast notification trigger when recording starts with a flagged device
   - Uses existing `ToastManager.showLowQualityDeviceWarning()` convenience method

### Verification:
- `swift build` passed successfully
- Warning icons display in device picker dropdown
- Toast notifications are dismissible and don't block recording
- All acceptance criteria met

### Commits:
- `cdd286c feat(US-505): add low-quality device warning for audio input selection`
- `a2ffa5a docs: update progress log for US-505`
