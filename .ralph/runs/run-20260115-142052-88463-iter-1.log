**Summary:**

US-801: Home Dashboard Header with Time-Based Greeting has been verified as complete.

**Implementation Details:**
- Time-based greeting shows "Good morning.", "Good afternoon.", or "Good evening." based on hour (<12, 12-17, >17)
- Subtitle displays "Ready to capture your thoughts? Your last session was X ago." (or fallback text when no previous sessions)
- Header includes DASHBOARD label (uppercase, letter spacing 4pt), date formatted as "Thursday, January 15", and System Active status indicator with green dot
- Uses `Font.Voxa.displayGreeting` (52pt system serif) for the editorial, Playfair Display-inspired aesthetic
