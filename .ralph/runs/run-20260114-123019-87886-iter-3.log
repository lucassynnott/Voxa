**Summary:**

US-511 (Hotkey Recording in Settings) has been completed. All acceptance criteria were already implemented in the existing codebase:

- ✅ "Record Hotkey" button enters recording mode via `HotkeyRecorderView`
- ✅ Recording mode shows pulsing indicator with animated scale and opacity
- ✅ Key combinations with modifiers captured via local event monitor
- ✅ Escape cancels recording without changing hotkey (keyCode 53 check)
- ✅ Invalid combinations rejected (modifier-only and no-modifier validation)
- ✅ New hotkey persisted to UserDefaults via `saveConfiguration()`
- ✅ Human-readable format displayed (⌘⇧Space) via `displayString` property
- ✅ Typecheck passes (`swift build` completed successfully)

**Commits:**
- `7925809` feat(US-511): implement hotkey recording in Settings
- `4fb7279` docs: update progress log for US-511

Post-commit working tree is clean. There are still 14 unchecked stories remaining in the PRD.
