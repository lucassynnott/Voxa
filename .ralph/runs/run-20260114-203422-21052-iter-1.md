**Iteration**: 1
**Story**: US-606 - Language Selection
**Status**: VERIFIED (already complete)

## Overview
This run verified that US-606 (Language Selection) was already fully implemented and committed by a parallel process. No new code changes were required.

## Verification Results
- **Build**: PASS (`swift build` completed in 0.13s)
- **Commit**: c54111c feat(US-606): implement language selection for transcription (existing)

## Acceptance Criteria (All Verified Complete)
- [x] Language dropdown in Settings (Auto-detect + common languages)
  - 12 languages: Auto-detect, English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Arabic
- [x] Pass language hint to WhisperKit
  - DecodingOptions created with `language` (code) and `detectLanguage` (bool) parameters
- [x] Remember language preference
  - Persisted via UserDefaults with key `selectedTranscriptionLanguage`
- [x] "Auto-detect" as default
  - `.automatic` case returns `nil` for whisperLanguageCode, `true` for detectLanguage

## Implementation Details
### WhisperManager.swift
- `TranscriptionLanguage` enum with 12 language options
- `selectedLanguage` @Published property with didSet persistence
- `selectedLanguageKey` constant for UserDefaults
- `whisperLanguageCode` computed property returning language code or nil
- `DecodingOptions` created in `transcribe()` method with language hint

### SettingsWindow.swift
- `LanguagePicker` component bound to `whisperManager.selectedLanguage`
- `LanguageRow` component using `WhisperManager.TranscriptionLanguage`
- Language dropdown in Transcription Settings tab
