There are still 3 stories remaining (US-203, US-204, US-205), so I cannot output the completion signal. US-202 is complete.

**Summary:**

Implemented US-202: Fix Audio Buffer Pipeline with the following changes:

1. **Lowered silence threshold** from -40dB to -55dB in both `AudioManager.swift` and `RecordingIndicatorWindow.swift` for more permissive audio detection
2. **Fixed dB calculation** using `20 * log10(max(amplitude, 1e-10))` to safely handle zero values without NaN or -Infinity
3. **Added buffer verification logging** confirming level meter and transcription buffer use the same input data path, with periodic buffer append count logging
4. **Added sample value logging** before silence check - first 10 and last 10 samples, plus zero sample percentage
5. **Added buffer sample count verification** to detect any mismatch between expected and actual collected samples
6. **Updated error messages** to use dynamic threshold value via `AudioManager.silenceThreshold`
