**Summary:**

US-513 (Clipboard Preservation) was already fully implemented in a prior iteration (commit `8f0edae feat(US-513): implement clipboard preservation`). All acceptance criteria are verified:

- ✅ Current clipboard content saved before text insertion (`saveClipboardContents()`)
- ✅ Transcribed text placed on clipboard (`pasteboard.setString()`)
- ✅ Cmd+V simulated to paste text (`simulatePaste()`)
- ✅ Original clipboard content restored after delay (800ms via `defaultRestoreDelay = 0.8`)
- ✅ Restoration happens in background thread (`DispatchQueue.global(qos: .utility)`)
- ✅ Typecheck passes (`swift build` succeeds)

This run verified the existing implementation and updated the progress log. Commit: `add5203 docs: update progress log for US-513 verification`.

There are still 12 unchecked stories remaining in the PRD (US-514 through US-525).
