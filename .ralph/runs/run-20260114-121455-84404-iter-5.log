## Summary

Successfully completed **US-510: Global Event Tap for Hotkeys**. 

**Changes made:**
1. **Rewrote `HotkeyManager.swift`** - Replaced Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` with CGEvent tap at `kCGSessionEventTap` level for reliable global hotkey detection that works regardless of which app is focused and even when WispFlow window is not visible.

2. **Updated `AppDelegate.swift`** - Added `showAccessibilityPermissionPrompt()` method to show an alert when hotkey is pressed without accessibility permission, with option to open System Settings.

**Key features implemented:**
- CGEvent tap at session level for true global hotkey detection
- Modifier keys detection: Command, Shift, Option, Control
- Default hotkey: Cmd+Shift+Space
- Auto-re-enable of tap if system disables it
- Permission prompt when accessibility permission is missing

**Verification:**
- `swift build` passes without errors

**Commits:**
- `5b530f0` feat(US-510): implement global event tap for hotkeys
- `5d8f7f1` docs: update progress log for US-510
