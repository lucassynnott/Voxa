## Summary

**US-523: Fix Tab Visibility** - Verified and complete.

The story was already implemented in a previous iteration. During this verification run:

1. **Verified US-523 implementation** - Window width increased to 750px, all 6 tabs visible with full labels (General, Audio, Transcription, Text Cleanup, Text Insertion, Debug), window is resizable with min size 750x560.

2. **Fixed blocking build error** - Added missing `startAudioBufferClearTimer()`, `stopAudioBufferClearTimer()`, and `clearAudioBuffer()` functions from incomplete US-608 implementation that was preventing `swift build` from passing.

3. **Build verification** - `swift build` now passes successfully.

4. **Commits**:
   - `c0f3d3b` - fix(US-608): add missing audio buffer clear timer functions
   - `d2adaea` - docs: add verification progress log for US-523

Post-commit status: **clean**

Note: There are 6 stories remaining in Phase 9 (UI Redesign) that are still open: US-615, US-632, US-633, US-634, US-635, US-636.
