Excellent! Working tree is clean. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

- **Task 3 (Post-Processing Toggles):** Three toggles persist via UserDefaults:
  - Auto-capitalize first letter (`$textCleanupManager.autoCapitalizeFirstLetter`)
  - Add period at end (`$textCleanupManager.addPeriodAtEnd`)

**Acceptance Criteria - All Met:**
- ✅ Cleanup toggle works
