**Summary:**

Implemented US-522: Onboarding Completion for WispFlow's onboarding wizard:

1. **Added completion step** (`OnboardingStep.completion`) to the onboarding flow
2. **Created `OnboardingCompletionView`** with:
   - Animated success illustration with checkmark
   - Success card showing completed steps (Microphone Access, Accessibility Access, Audio Test, Hotkey Configuration) with dynamic status from `PermissionManager`
   - Hotkey recap card showing how to start recording (e.g., "Press ⌘⇧Space")
   - "Start Using WispFlow" button that closes wizard
3. **`hasCompletedOnboarding` flag** is set to true when user clicks the button (via existing `markOnboardingCompleted()`)
4. **Menu bar icon** is already visible and ready (set up in AppDelegate)
