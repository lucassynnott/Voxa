## Summary

I have successfully implemented **US-635: Snippets Library View** with the following features:

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **Sources/WispFlow/SnippetsManager.swift** (new) - Complete snippet data model and manager
2. **Sources/WispFlow/MainWindow.swift** (modified) - Full snippets library UI implementation
3. **.ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** (updated) - Marked US-635 as complete with implementation notes

### Implementation Details:
- **Snippet data model** with id, title, content, optional shortcut, timestamps, and computed properties (wordCount, characterCount, contentPreview)
- **SnippetsManager singleton** with CRUD operations, search/filter, shortcut validation, and UserDefaults persistence
- **SnippetsContentView** with grid/list toggle views, search bar, create button, and empty states
- **SnippetCard** (grid view) and **SnippetListRow** (list view) components with hover effects, expand/collapse, and action buttons
- **CreateSnippetSheet** and **EditSnippetSheet** modal forms with shortcut validation
- Delete confirmation dialog and quick copy to clipboard functionality

### Verification:
- Build passes: `swift build` → PASS
- Commits: `b163d0d feat(US-635): Snippets Library View...` and `4ef3480 docs: add progress log...`
- Post-commit status: clean

There is still one remaining story (US-636: Custom Dictionary View) in the PRD that is not complete, so the `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` signal should NOT be output.
