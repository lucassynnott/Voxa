# Run Log: US-803 Recent Transcriptions List
Run ID: 20260115-142039-88012
Iteration: 3
Date: 2026-01-15

## Actions Taken

1. Read guardrails.md, errors.log, and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Read AGENTS.md and MainWindow.swift to audit codebase
3. Discovered duplicate RecentTranscriptionItem struct causing compilation errors
4. Confirmed duplicate was already removed by parallel run (commit d472e51)
5. Verified swift build passes successfully
6. Confirmed US-803 is marked complete in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

## Verification Results

- Command: `swift build` -> PASS (Build complete!)
- All US-803 tasks verified complete:
  - [x] Create section header with Playfair Display italic
  - [x] Add View All link
  - [x] Build transcription item component with icon, title, subtitle, timestamp
  - [x] Implement hover states
  - [x] Connect to transcription history data

## Implementation Details

### Key Files (already implemented)
- Sources/Voxa/MainWindow.swift:
  - `recentTranscriptionsSection`: Section with header, View All link, and list/empty state
  - `recentTranscriptionsEmptyState`: Empty state with waveform icon and hint
  - `recentTranscriptionsList`: VStack of RecentTranscriptionItem components
  - `RecentTranscriptionItem`: Component with icon, title, subtitle, timestamp, hover states

### Components Verified
- Section header uses `Font.Voxa.sectionHeaderItalic` (18pt serif italic)
- View All link navigates via `.navigateToHistory` notification
- RecentTranscriptionItem displays:
  - Icon: waveform in colored circle
  - Title: derived from first line of transcription
  - Subtitle: word count + duration
  - Timestamp: relative date string
- Hover states:
  - Title color changes from textPrimary to accent
  - Background highlight with surfaceSecondary at 50% opacity
- Shows up to 5 transcriptions via `prefix(5)` on recentEntries

## Outcome

US-803 was already fully implemented by parallel runs (particularly commit d472e51 which removed duplicate struct). This iteration verified the implementation and confirmed all acceptance criteria are met.

## Remaining Work

US-803 is complete. Remaining uncompleted stories in Phase 11:
- US-805: Quick Tools Section
- US-806: Sidebar Navigation Redesign
- US-807: Dashboard Layout Grid
- US-808: Typography System Update
