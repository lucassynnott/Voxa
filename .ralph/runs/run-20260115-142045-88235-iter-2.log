There are still 6 unchecked stories remaining in the implementation plan (US-803 through US-808), so the PRD is not complete. The selected story US-802 has been successfully implemented and verified.

## Summary

**US-802: Start Recording Button** has been successfully completed. All acceptance criteria are met:

1. ✅ **Button triggers recording** - Posts `.toggleRecording` notification which AppDelegate observes to toggle recording state
2. ✅ **Hover state with lift effect** - Shadow, scale, and Y offset changes on hover
3. ✅ **Shows Stop Recording when active** - Button text changes to "Stop Recording" and icon changes to stop.fill, background changes to red

- Pill-shaped button using `Capsule()` with terracotta (`Color.Voxa.accent`) background
- Microphone icon with pulse animation when recording
- Keyboard shortcut badge showing "⌘⇧Space"
- Recording functionality connected via NotificationCenter notifications
