There are still 9 unchecked stories in the PRD (US-517 through US-525), so this is not the final story and I should not output the completion signal.

## Summary

**US-516: First Launch Detection** has been verified as complete. The implementation was already done in a previous iteration:

- **File created:** `Sources/WispFlow/OnboardingManager.swift`
- **Commit:** `deecf6f feat(US-516): implement first launch detection for onboarding wizard`
- **All acceptance criteria verified:**
  - ✅ Check UserDefaults for `hasCompletedOnboarding` flag
  - ✅ First launch: flag is nil or false (returns `isFirstLaunch = true`)
  - ✅ Subsequent launches: flag is true (returns `isFirstLaunch = false`)
  - ✅ Flag only set to true after wizard completed or skipped (`markOnboardingCompleted()` and `markOnboardingSkipped()` methods)
  - ✅ Typecheck passes (`swift build` succeeds)

The progress log has been updated with the verification entry and committed (`8e3dccc docs: update progress log for US-516 verification`).
